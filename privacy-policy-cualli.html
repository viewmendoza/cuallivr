<p></p><strong>OMNIVR POLICY</strong><p></p>
Information we collect
We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which OmniVirt videos you might like.
We collect information in the following ways:
INFORMATION YOU GIVE US.
 For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a OmniVirt Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account.
INFORMATION WE GET FROM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES.
 We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on OmniVirt, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:
DEVICE INFORMATION
We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). OmniVirt may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your OmniVirt Account.
LOG INFORMATION
When you use our services or view content provided by OmniVirt, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:
details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.
Internet protocol address.
device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your OmniVirt Account.
LOCATION INFORMATION
When you use OmniVirt services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide OmniVirt with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.
UNIQUE APPLICATION NUMBERS
Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to OmniVirt when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.
LOCAL STORAGE
We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES
We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a OmniVirt service, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or OmniVirt features that may appear on other sites. Our OmniVirt Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, OmniVirt Analytics information is linked, by the OmniVirt Analytics customer or by OmniVirt, using OmniVirt technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.
Information we collect when you are signed in to OmniVirt, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your OmniVirt Account. When information is associated with your OmniVirt Account, we treat it as personal information.

How we use information we collect
We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect OmniVirt and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.

We may use the name you provide for your OmniVirt Profile across all of the services we offer that require a OmniVirt Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your OmniVirt Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible OmniVirt Profile information, such as your name and photo.

If you have a OmniVirt Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on OmniVirt or on third-party applications connected to your OmniVirt Account in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts.

When you contact OmniVirt, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to inform you about our services, such as letting you know about upcoming changes or improvements.

We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is OmniVirt Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.

We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other OmniVirt services – for example to make it easier to share things with people you know.

We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.

OmniVirt processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.

Information you share
Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.
Accessing and updating your personal information
Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
Information we share
We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of OmniVirt unless one of the following circumstances applies:
WITH YOUR CONSENT
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of OmniVirt when we have your consent to do so. We require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information.
FOR EXTERNAL PROCESSING
We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
FOR LEGAL REASONS
We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of OmniVirt if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of OmniVirt, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
If OmniVirt is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Information security
We work hard to protect OmniVirt and our users from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of information we hold. In particular:
We encrypt many of our services using SSL.
We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.
We restrict access to personal information to OmniVirt employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

If a present or potential violation is detected the Company shall investigate the reasons and decide if the violation may be cured. The Company shall assign officers to manage the violation or terminate the relations with the respective partner or data subject which will result in suspension of data processing.
In case of a personal data breach, the Company shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay.
The notification shall at least:
describe the nature of the personal data breach including where possible, the categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned and the categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;
communicate the name and contact point where more information can be obtained;
describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach;
describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.

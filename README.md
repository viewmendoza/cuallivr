This is a webpage created for a game published in Google Play. It is a short explanatory guide on what can be expected of the game.
It was created using a bootstrap theme plus foundation zurb elements. Almost all the site is built with CSS, HTML and SCSS. 
Logos and icons were created as .svg and fontawesome to make them responsive and sharp. The images are taken directly from the game and imposed in Photoshop.
